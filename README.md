The file manager program works by interacting with the file system of the operating system. When the user launches the program, it displays the current directory and the list of files and folders in that directory. The user can navigate through the directories by using commands such as "cd" to change the current directory and "ls" to list the contents of the current directory.

The program allows the user to create and delete files and folders by using commands such as "mkdir" to create a new folder and "rm" to delete a file or folder. The user can also copy and move files between directories by using the "cp" and "mv" commands.

The program provides a user-friendly interface to make it easy for the user to interact with the file system. The interface may include features such as a graphical display of the directories and files, drag and drop functionality, and context menus for performing common file management tasks.
